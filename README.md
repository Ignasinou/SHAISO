## ShAISo: Ships, AIS, and Sound

</div>

**ShAISo is an innovative project that merges music (or noise) with Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology.**

AIS is an automatic tracking system that uses transceivers on ships and vessels to provide information such as unique identification, position, course, and speed.

Underwater noise produced by vessels is significant and often elevated. ShAISo combines real-time vessel tracking with sound generated by PureData. The noise produced is directly influenced by the positions of the vessels in a specific zone: the closer the vessels, the more disruptive the sound.
